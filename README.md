# geoAPI
Simple API for storing/retrieving geotagged metadata, built with Node.js and MongoDB.

It is implementing a simple way to expose a REST API from a model defined in MongoDB. Besides the REST exposure, also offers integrated authentification based on Passport Basic Schema, Twitter Authentification and OAUTH2.

It can be used to build custom REST API implementations, not only geoData, but any schema you want.
